"""Band-integrated LWIR emissivity of a water surface, and the sky it reflects.

Blender is an RGB renderer with no concept of the 8-14 um band, and its Fresnel node
takes a scalar IOR where water needs a complex one (n + i*k). So these curves are
evaluated here and the shader consumes them as 1D lookups. Path extinction is not
modelled. Angles are radians.

A sea surface emits and reflects, and the two are complements: `1 - eps` of what it does
not emit comes back as reflected sky. Leave the reflection out and the sea goes black at
grazing incidence, which is most of a maritime image.

24(2) 313, 1988 (doi:10.1016/0034-4257(88)90032-6). The inter-facet reflection term it
omits is in Wu & Smith, "Emissivity of rough sea surface for 8-13 um: modeling and
verification", Applied Optics 36(12) 2609, 1997 (doi:10.1364/AO.36.002609).

Sky emissivity: one LOWTRAN7 run, midlatitude summer profile with the navy maritime
aerosol, observer at 12 m, integrated over the band. LOWTRAN7 is public-domain
(AFGL-TR-88-0177); the run is reproducible with `lowtran` on PyPI, which needs gfortran.
It is a band model, not line-by-line, and the profile is fixed: good to a few percent,
not a radiometric reference.

h, c and k_B are the SI defining constants, exact since the 2019 redefinition.

Planck's law and Fresnel for an absorbing medium are textbook, but carry two assumptions
that fail silently:

- Kirchhoff's law, eps = 1 - R. Holds because water is opaque across this band well
  inside any depth the sensor resolves, so there is no transmitted term.
- Band emissivity is the Planck-weighted mean of the spectral emissivity. Exact only for
  a flat sensor response.
