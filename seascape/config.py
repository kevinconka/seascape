"""Scenario config: pydantic models, and a TOML loader that never guesses.

A scenario is a TOML file. Two forms of reuse, both resolved here:

- `extends = "baseline.toml"` at the top level, for a variant that is a diff.
- `preset = "twin_pod"` inside a block, next to the overrides it applies to.

Rules:

1. `preset` is a key inside its block, so there are no precedence rules between
   parents.
2. Syntax decides what a name is. A bare name is a preset shipped under `cfg/`,
   anything with `/` or ending in `.toml` is a path relative to the including file.
   Never try one form and fall back to the other.
3. Tables merge, everything else replaces. A list is replaced whole.
